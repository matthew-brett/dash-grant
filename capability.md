This document should be completed in Arial 11pt, margins must not be less than 2cm, and each page should be numbered. The final version must not exceed 2 pages (the instructions and guidance notes should be deleted).

Your capability to deliver should be a narrative explaining the teamâ€™s
experience and expertise relevant to delivering the proposed programme. You
should explain the contribution to the project of each named Investigator
(PI/Co-I), including a clear time commitment. This should be in the form of
a succinct personal statement, providing evidence of the skills and expertise
they will bring to the project. CV information which simply lists past
positions, publications and funding will not adequately support an application.

Guidance

Only one document should be completed per application, regardless of the number
of named investigators. Personal statements should include information on areas
such as those listed below. You can determine the appropriate balance of
information relevant to your team and the goals of your proposal:

1.  Role within the project, and time commitment
2.  Relevant skills and expertise, for example:

    Contribution to the generation and flow of new ideas, knowledge, tools, and
    approaches

    Examples might include: key skills and contributions to past projects, key outputs such as data sets, software, research and policy publications, experience in provision of quality training resources. The relevance to delivering the proposed project should be summarised.

    Contribution to research teams and the development of others.

    Examples might include: project management, supervision, mentoring or line
    management contributions critical to the success of a team, or where you
    exerted strategic leadership in shaping the direction of a team,
    organisation, company or institution. Teaching/ training activities (e.g.
    workshops/ summer schools) delivered to different audiences.

    Contributions to the research community

    Examples might include: how you have contributed to wider collaborations
    and networks across disciplines, institutions, and / or countries, open
    research, commitments such as reviewing and committee work, positions of
    responsibility, and activities which have contributed to the improvement of
    research integrity or culture, or examples where you have shown visionary
    strategic leadership in influencing a research agenda.

    Contributions to broader society

    Examples might include: engagement with the public and/ or private sectors,
    how you have ensured your research/ training reaches and influences
    relevant audiences, how you have increased equity in the benefits from
    research.
