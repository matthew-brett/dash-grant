Justification of resources (maximum of two sides of A4)

Cross council guidance on writing a good justification of resources (JoR) document is available on the Je-S Handbook.

For the DaSH scheme, the majority of costings should be entered be under
‘Exceptions’ for each heading. See Resource Summary for further details.

The role of the JoR is to aid reviewers when assessing proposals so that they
can make an informed judgment on whether the resources requested are
appropriate for the research posed. The JoR is a mandatory attachment to the
proposal and should be no more than two sides of A4. It should take into
account the nature and complexity of the proposal. It should not simply be
a list of the resources required (already defined in the Je-S form). All items
requested in the Je-S form must be justified in the JoR. The JoR is a free text
document. We recommend that you match the costs to the proposal headings below
(where appropriate) so that you do not miss any costings from the Je-S form or
any justifications for the items requested. All items listed under Exceptions
must be fully justified as to how they will directly contribute to development
and delivery of training.
