**Background**: Data science is an approach to data analysis with a foundation
in code and algorithms [^cfd-what-is].  It is not new; rather it is
a recognition of the central role that code and computing has played in data
analysis since computing became widely available [@donoho201550].  Data
science requires that we take code seriously.  "Coding" is not a useful
additional skill for advanced research, but the foundation for all modern
quantitative data analysis.  Thus understood, coding is comparable to bench
skills and process in wet-lab research.  Every wet-lab researcher must learn
bench skills, and the use of a lab notebook; every researcher doing
quantitative data analysis must learn code for data analysis, and they must
learn organized process for using code and data.  The consequences of not
doing so are the same as those for the poorly trained wet-lab researcher;
a poorly trained data analyst will be disabled by confusion and error.  This
is the central message of computational reproducibility
[@donoho2010invitation]; if we do not take code seriously, our work will be
full of error, and poor organization means that the analysis is hard to share
and difficult to extend. This leads to enormous waste in wrong results and
repeated work.

Education in data science has revealed another fundamental idea; that code is
the right and fruitful foundation for teaching the central ideas of
statistical inference and prediction.  Neither is this a new insight; teachers
of statistics have been making this case for many years.  The mathematical
formulation that generations of students have suffered was necessary because
we needed to simplify calculations for lack of computing power;
@cobb2007introductory phrases this as "mathematics as computational engine".
Now we have an abundance of computing power, we can use much simpler
resampling algorithms that are easy to express in code: "computation as
computational engine".  This gives students a deeper understanding of the
underlying ideas of statistical inference. It also makes it natural to
progress from standard statistical inference to machine learning and
prediction.

Data science teaching therefore contains three fundamental ideas:

1. **code-as-analysis**; the recognition of the central role of code in
   expression the algorithms of practical data analysis;
1. **code-to-learn**; in contrast to the approach where "coding" is an
   optional additional skill --- "learning to code" --- "code-to-learn" uses
   code as the basis to explain the algorithms of inference and prediction.
1. **code-for-reproducibility**; taking code seriously must involve careful
   process in the organization and sharing of code and data.  Learning to use
   code in this way leads to reproducibility as a natural product of organized
   working process --- **reproducibility by design**.

We are early in this recognition of code as foundation.  In particular our training has been slow to reflect the r
