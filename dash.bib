  abstract = {An analysis of the Functional Imaging Analysis Contest (FIAC) data
	is presented using spatial wavelet processing. This technique allows
	the image to be filtered adaptively according to the data itself,
	rather than relying on a predetermined filter. This adaptive filtering
	leads to better estimation of the parameters and contrasts in terms
	of mean squared error. It will be shown that by introducing a slight
	bias into the estimation, a large reduction in the variance can be
	achieved, leading to better overall mean squared error estimates.
	As no single filter needs to be preselected, results containing many
	scales of information can be found. In the FIAC data, it is shown
	that both small-scale and large-scale (smoother, more dispersed)
	effects occur. The combination of small- and large-scale effects
	detected in the FIAC data would be easy to miss using conventional
	single filter analysis.},
